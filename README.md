Final Outcome  

Geometrical Band - Practice Version

I use Three.js to build the geometry and skybox, add Positional Audio to the scene and bind to the different geometry to make them sound like different instruments. I then used the TrackballControls plugin to get the interactive functionality I wanted, i.e. left mouse button to rotate, the right mouse button to pan and the scroll wheel to zoom. To allow the user to move closer to the different geometries and thus hear the volume changes of the different audio.
Finally, I used Maximilian.js to mix the sounds of these instruments to form a soundtrack, which is perhaps a little noisy, but it is exactly what the band would sound like when practising their instruments.
